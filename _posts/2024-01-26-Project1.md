Through analysis of this data, I would like to solve the following question: What factors effect the risk that a vessel is attacked by pirates? (shore proximity, date/season, country, boat type, etc.)
## Introduction to the Data
This dataset was found on Kaggle. It consists of over 7500 pirate attacks cataloged between the years 1993 and 2020. 
## Pre-processing
The dataset had a large amount of null data, specifically in categories like description, vessel_type and time.

## Data Visualization
![Yearly Attacks](/assets/Attacks per Year.png)
![Monthly Attacks](/assets/months.png)
<br> Month does not appear to be a factor
![Distance Histogram](/assets/distancehist.png)
<br> A majority of attacks happen close to the shoreline. A attacks do occur between 200km and 1000km away from the shore, but are uncommon. I cut off the data after 600km for the sake of the graph. Explain stuff ...
![Distance Histogram 0-50](/assets/distance50.png)
<br> After zooming in on the previous graph, we can see that the number of attacks decreases exponentially(?) farther from the shore. Most attacks actually occur between 0 and 10km from the shoreline, with 0-1km being the most common value. If we take the median ...
![Ship Status](/assets/status.png)
<br> There are three main ship status types. They are:
- Anchored: Anchored in place in open water
- Berthed: Docking at a port or other structure
- Steaming: Vessel is currently traveling
<br> After seeing that a majority of attacks happen to boats close to the shoreline, it makes sense that most of attacked ships would either be anchored or berthed. ...
