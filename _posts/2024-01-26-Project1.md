## Introduction
Through analysis of this data, I would like to solve the following question: What factors effect the risk that a vessel is attacked by pirates? (shore proximity, time/season, country, boat type, etc.)
## Introduction to the Data
This dataset was found on Kaggle. It consists of over 7500 pirate attacks cataloged between the years 1993 and 2020.
