## Introduction
Through analysis of this data, I would like to solve the following question: What factors effect the risk that a vessel is attacked by pirates? (shore proximity, date/season, country, boat type, etc.)
## Introduction to the Data
This dataset was found on Kaggle. It consists of over 7500 pirate attacks cataloged between the years 1993 and 2020. 
## Pre-processing
The dataset had a large amount of null data, specifically in categories like description, vessel_type and time.

![Ship Status](/assets/status.png)
<br> There are three main ship status types. They are:
- Anchored: Anchored in place in open water
- Berthed: Docking at a port or other structure
- Steaming: Vessel is currently traveling
After seeing that a majority of attacks happen to boats close to the shoreline, it makes sense that most of attacked ships would either be anchored or berthed. Th
