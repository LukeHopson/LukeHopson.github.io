Throughout history, wherever martime commerce has flourished, piracy has also been present. The modern age is no exception to this, as global trade is currently at it's zenith, with billions of tons of cargo being transported over the ocean each year. While only a small percentage of ships are faced with such situations, piracy has an effect on global shipping. Through analysis of this data set on pirate attacks, I would like to answer the following question: What factors influence the risk that a vessel is attacked by pirates? 
## Introduction to the Data
My data set consists of a few different .csv files. The first, and most important of these has over 7500 rows, one for each pirate attack cataloged between the years 1993 and 2020. It has 16 columns, covering details of each attack such as date, latitude/longitude, boat type, shore distance, etc. The second .csv file covers stats like corruption, unemployment, and GDP correlating to the countries where the attacks occured. This information could be useful for a future projects, specifically if one wanted to analyize the socio-economic causes of piracy. However, as that is not the primary question I am aiming to answer with this analyisis, I will primarly be using the first file. The data set was found on Kaggle and the link can be accessed in the References section of this project. 
## Pre-processing
I chose to drop the columns attack_description, vessel_name, data_source as I did not plan on using them in my analysis. The dataset had a large amount of null data in the vessel_type and time columns. Due to this, I chose to prune those two columns. The information in those columns could have been useful, but there were too many null values (6338/7500) to feel confident with any conclusions produced from the data.

Below I have included a figure of the table of the number of null values per column.
'''attack_df.isna().sum()'''

## Data Visualization
<br>![Yearly Attacks](/assets/Attacks per Year.png)
<br>![Monthly Attacks](/assets/months.png)
<br> Month does not appear to be a factor
<br>![Distance Histogram](/assets/distancehist.png)
<br> A majority of attacks happen close to the shoreline. A attacks do occur between 200km and 1000km away from the shore, but are uncommon. I cut off the data after 600km for the sake of the graph. Explain stuff ...
<br>![Distance Histogram 0-50](/assets/distance50.png)
<br> After zooming in on the previous graph, we can see that the fequency of attacks drops off rapidly as distance from the shore increases. Most attacks actually occur between 0 and 10km from the shoreline, with 0-1km being the most common value. If we take the median ...
<br>![Ship Status](/assets/status.png)
<br> There are three main ship status types. They are:
- Anchored: Anchored in place in open water
- Berthed: Docking at a port or other structure
- Steaming: Vessel is currently traveling
<!-- -->
<br> After seeing that a majority of attacks happen to boats close to the shoreline in the previous visualization, it makes sense that most of attacked ships would either be anchored or berthed. This is likley because ships that are both close to the shore line and not moving are easier targets for pirates.
