Throughout history, wherever martime commerce has flourished, piracy has also been present. The modern age is no exception to this, as global trade is currently at it's zenith, with billions of tons of cargo being transported over the ocean each year. While only a small percentage of ships are faced with such situations, piracy has an effect on global shipping. Through analysis of this data set on pirate attacks, I would like to answer the following question: What factors influence the risk that a vessel is attacked by pirates? 
## Introduction to the Data
My data set consists of a few different .csv files. The first, and most important of these has over 7500 rows, one for each pirate attack cataloged between the years 1993 and 2020. It has 16 columns, covering details of each attack such as date, latitude/longitude, boat type, shore distance, etc. The second .csv file covers stats like corruption, unemployment, and GDP correlating to the countries where the attacks occured. This information could be useful for a future projects, specifically if one wanted to analyize the socio-economic causes of piracy. However, as that is not the primary question I am aiming to answer with this analyisis, I will primarly be using the first file. The data set was found on Kaggle and the link can be accessed in the References section of this project. 
## Pre-processing
I chose to drop the columns attack_description, vessel_name, data_source as I did not plan on using them in my analysis. The dataset had a large amount of null data in the vessel_type and time columns. Due to this, I chose to prune those two columns. The information in those columns could have been useful, but there were too many null values (6338/7500) to feel confident with any conclusions produced from the data.

Below I have included a figure of the table of the number of null values per column.

## Data Visualization
![Yearly Attacks](/assets/Attacks per Year.png)
<br>The first thing I chose to graph was the number of attacks per year. This seemed like an obvious statistic to cover and the graph has some interesting characteristics. There are clearly two time periods with spikes in pirate attacks. Also, we can see that in recent years, piracy has beeng declining gradally. <br>
<br>![Monthly Attacks](/assets/months.png)
<br> Month does not appear to be a major factor for pirate attacks, but there are slightly less attacks in the months of February, June, July, August and Decemeber compared to the other months. There are a few possible explainations for this. First, in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, which happens to be a hotspot for piracy, the months of June, July and August typically have heavy rains and rough seas due to monsoon season. Decreased visibility would make it more difficult for pirates to spot potential targets and rough seas could make it more difficult for pirates using smaller sized skiffs. <br>
<br>![Distance Histogram](/assets/distancehist.png)
<br> I chose to graph the number of pirate attacks in relation to distance from the shoreline, and a clear trend can be seen. A majority of attacks happen close to the shoreline. Attacks have occured up to 1000km away from the shore, but are uncommon. Due to this, I cut off the data after 600km to improve the readability of the graph. <br>
<br>![Distance Histogram 0-50](/assets/distance50.png)
<br> To get a better view on the previous graph, I chose to zoom in on the range 0-50km away from shore. Here, we can see that the fequency of attacks drops off rapidly as distance from the shore increases. Most attacks actually occur between 0 and 10km from the shoreline, with 0-1km being the most common value. <br>
<br>![Ship Status](/assets/status.png)
<br> There are three main ship status types. They are:
- Anchored: Anchored in place in open water
- Berthed: Docking at a port or other structure
- Steaming: Vessel is currently traveling<!-- --> </a>
<br> After seeing that a majority of attacks happen to boats close to the shoreline in the previous visualization, it makes sense that most of attacked ships would either be anchored or berthed. This could be explained by the fact that stationary ships closer to the shore would be easier targets for pirates. <br>

## Storytelling
After the analysis of this data set, I believe I have answered my initial question. We can clearly see a few factors that affect the number of pirate attacks. First, attacks are more common on ships closer to the shoreline. The farther out, the less likely it is that a ship is attacked. With this comes the stat that ships are more commonly while 'steaming'. 'Steaming' ships are more likely to be father from the shoreline, and boats closer to the shoreline are more likley to be anchored or berthered.
## Impact
There are a few possible impacts that could result from the figures above. A positive effect is that global shipping costs could be reduced by having a better understanding of piracy. Shipping companies could know when there ships are most likely to be attacked. For example, based on the data in my shore distance and ship status figures, they could choose to take extra security precautions during the time period when boats are stationary and close to shore.
There is also the potential negative impact that countries with high piracy rates may lose economic revenue if shipping companies decide to avoid the region based on piracy. A loss in revenue from ships passing through the area could could excaberate the economic conditions that lead to piracy becoming necessary for indivudals to make a living. Second, it is possible that not all characteristics that factor into pirate are included in my analysis. Ship type, ship security presence and cargo value are a few I can think of.
