## Introduction to the data
There are over 100 million homes in the United States, each having different energy consumption. By understanding the energy usage of homes, it is possible to reduce the energy expenses, build more efficient homes, and conserve energy.

I found a dataset that covers the details of residental homes and their subsequent energy usage. The dataset is contains 5600 homes which were specifically chosen by the EIA (Energy Information Administration) to be representative of all homes in the United States. This data was taken in a 2015 survey, so should be accurate today. Overall, there are around 750 columns which cover stats like total energy usage, square footage, insualtion quality, number of appliances, etc. With this data, I would like to estimate the energy consumption of a residentaial building with my regression model.

Before we get into the regressions, I will quickly define some of the column names I will reference in this project:\n
TOTALBTU: Energy output measured in British Thermal Units, 1 kWh is equal to 3,412 BTU. This is the target variable in my experiments.\n
TOTALSQFT_EN: Total square footage of living space, includes extra areas like attics, garages and cellars if they have temerature control.\n

## What is regression?
Linear regression plots the relation between a numerical depdendent variable and one or more independent variables. As the name of the technique suggests, we model this relationship with a straight line. With this regression line, we can predict other values based on where they would fit on the line.

## Pre-processing
I removed all columns of data type string, so I was only left with numerical data. I dropped one column that had a considerable amount of null values. I also removed all of the 'BTU' columns. These all add to the variable 'TOTALBTU', making them unecessary. If these are not removed, the linear regression will always be perfect. I removed a handful of other columns that are not important, but will not cover every one in this explaniation, as I removed around 400 columns. 

## Experiment 1: Data understanding
First, I checked which features had high correlations the TOTALBTU (energy used).

From the result, we can see that total square footage is the most important factor, followed by number of windows, if the room has a cellar, then number of bedrooms and so on.

## Experiment 1: Modeling
In figure below, the dotted line represents a perfect regression line (where the actual value is equivalent to the predicted).

## Experiment 1: Evaluation
![Eval](assets/exp1e.png)

Based on the evaluation, the model appears to be fairly accurate. With BTU ranging from 0 to 500,000, a mean absolute error of 20,000 is terrible for error measurements. Still, this regression perfect, I will try to find a model with a stronger trend.

## Experiment 2:
In this experiment I made one major change. Instead of using a regular linear regression, I used a Random Forest Regressor. The main goal of this experiment was to see which performed better.

Based on this evaluation, we can see that the Random Forest Regressor was slighly worse than the model in Experiment 1.

## Experiment 3:
For this last experiment, I decided to see see what would happen if I only used that column with the biggest correlation to 'TOTALBTU' in the regression. As shown in the data understanding section, the feature with the strongest correlation to 'TOTALBTU' was 'TOTSQFT_EN'.

First, I plotted the relationship between 'TOTALBTU' and 'TOTSQFT_EN', including it's regression line.

![Eval2](assets/exp3e.png)

From these numbers, we can see that the linear regression only using the feature with the highest correlation to TOTALBTU is the worst of the three experiments.

## Impact
Positive: Understanding which factors cause higher energy usage can improve building standards, help homeowners reduce energy bills, and save energy.
Negative: After seeing that energy usage is highly correlated with home

## Conclusions
The experiments show that a regular linear regression performs better than a Random Forest Regressor with this data set.
