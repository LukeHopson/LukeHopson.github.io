## Introduction to the data
There are over 100 million homes in the United States, each having different energy consumption. By understanding the energy usage of homes, it is possible to reduce the energy expenses, build more efficient homes, and conserve energy.

I found a dataset that covers the details of residental homes and their subsequent energy usage. The dataset is contains 5600 homes which were specifically chosen by the EIA (Energy Information Administration) to be representative of all homes in the United States. This data was taken in a 2015 survey, so should be accurate today. Overall, there are around 750 columns which cover stats like total energy usage, square footage, insualtion quality, number of appliances, etc. With this data, I would like to estimate the energy consumption of a residentaial building with my regression model.
## What is regression?
Linear regression plots the relation between a numerical depdendent variable and one or more independent variables. As the name of the technique suggests, we model this relationship with a straight line. With this regression line, we can predict other values based on where they would fit on the line.
## Pre-processing
I removed all columns of data type string, so I was only left with numerical data. I dropped one column that had a considerable amount of null values. I also removed all of the 'BTU' columns. These all add to the variable 'TOTALBTU', making them unecessary. If these are not removed, the linear regression will always be perfect. I removed a handful of other columns that are not important, but will not cover every one in this explaniation, as I removed around 400 columns. 
## Data understanding
## Experiment 1:
![Model](assets/exp1.png)

TOTALBTU: Energy output measured in British Thermal Units, 1 kWh is equal to 3,412 BTU

![Eval](assets/exp1e.png)

Based on the evaluation, the model appears to be fairly accurate. With BTU ranging from 0 to 500,000, 29,000 and 38,000 aren't terrible for error measurements. Still, this regression isn't great, I will try to find a model with a stronger trend.
