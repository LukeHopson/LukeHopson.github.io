## Introduction to the Data
I found a data set that consists of roughly 4,000 planets outside of our Solar System. The dataset has 118 columns which cover statistics for both a planet and its nearest star. Some of these include but are not limited to: gravity, distance from star, temperature, star mass, planet type and tidal lock. Most importantly, there is a column making an estimate on the habitability of the planet. With this dataset, I would like to make a classification model to predict the habitability of any given exoplanet. I originally found the data on Kaggle, but found an updated version of the dataset from the original source (the University of Puerto Rico), which compiled the data from the NASA exoplanet archives.

## Pre-processing
Overall, this data set was fairly clean. Out of 118 columns, there were a few that were completly null, which I removed. Other than this, I removed a few uncessary columns that consisted of planet, constellation and star names. 

Next, I removed all columns that had 'MIN' and 'MAX' in them. This is because there were a few columns relating to the potential error in NASA's math caculations. For example, the column P_MASS_ERROR_MAX (max error for the estimated planet mass). These will have no effect on planet habitability. Interestingly, before these had been pruned, my models incorrectly decided that these as columns had high relation to habitability. 

Next, I used dummies to set columns with the type 'object' to boolean values. 
## Data Exploration and Visualization 
First, I decided to graph the relationship between the ESI (Earth Similarity Index) score of a planet, and it's habitability, as I expected there to be a strong relationship.

As expected, the planets predicted as habitable tend to have a higher Earth Similarity Index (ESI) . However, this measurement can't be decisive, as there are uninhabitable planets that score very similar to Earth and habitable planets that score on the lower end. I do notice that there seem to be a cutoff in the the overlap of the two columns. There are no "Uninhabitable" planets with an ESI higher than around 85%, and no "Habitable" planets with an ESI less than around 45%. 

## Modeling
I chose to model the data using a decision tree. I chose this model because decision trees are extremely easy to understand, even for those who do not have a background in stats or CS. As the name suggests, a decision tree model makes a tree-like structure, and following the path from root down to the leaf nodes allows us to predict the outcome. I set x to be habitability, y to every other column, then split the data into training and testing sets. I chose a split of 80% training to 20% testing. 
![Tree3](assets/df4.png)  
In this decision tree, orange represents a habitability prediction of uninhabitable, purple is optimistically habitable, green is conservatively habitable. 

The root node in the decision tree is planet surface temperature. First, if the planet temperature is greater than 326 Degress Kelvin (127 degrees Fahrenheit), the planet is uninhabitable. Every single sampled planet with a surface temp of greater than 326K was also predicted to be uninhabitable (and there were more than 2700 of them). 

Moving down the tree, the next node I would like to take a look at is P_TYPE_Superterran. This variable means that the planet of type superterran, meaning Earth-like, but it is larger than Earth. Interestingly, this node turns out to be the divide between optimistically (purple) and conservatively (green) habitable planets. Out of the remaining 43 samples, all planets that will be predicted as optimistically habitable are of type Superterran (boolean value of 1), and all conservatively habitable planets are not of Superterran type. 

Past this, a node measuring P_HABZONE_OPT (if a planet is in the optimal habitable zone) is used to seperate the remaining uninhabitable planets.

Next, I decided to combine the two different values representing positive habitablility (purple and green in the prior trees) into one value. This gives a simpler decision tree, which can be seen below:

In this tree, we look at the planet surface temp in the root node, similar to the last tree. Also similar to the last tree, all 2746 sampled planets with a surface temperature of greater than 318 Kelvin are uninhabitable. The remaining 38 samples consist of 35 habitable and 3 uninhabitable planets. Next, I would like to look at the P_ESI node. I looked at the variable P_ESI (planet Earth Similarity Index) in my data exploration section. At this point, all 34 remaining planets with a ESI of at least 55.7% are habitable, and the 3 planets with ESI values less than that are uninhabitable.

## Evaluation
Overall, my model was strong. I chose to use accuracy as my main measurement, because it is a simple measurement to understand. Each time it ran, I had an accuracy score of at least 98%, usually closer to the end of 99% accuracy.

This is the accuracy of my first decision tree. A score 99.65% is very good.

Similarly, the simpler decision tree had a high accuracy value, at 99.86%

## Storytelling
With this model, I believe I have reached the initial goal of this project. With the decision trees, we can see the main factors that play in to habitability. Additionally, if a new planet is discovered, we can use the decision trees to predict if it will be habitable. To demonstrate this, I found a planet that was discovered this year. This planet is called Wolf 237b. It is not in my dataset, and as far as I can tell, does not yet have a habitability prediction on any sites.

The planet has an estimate surface temperature of 996 Kelvin. Following either of my decision trees, I can go ahead and predict that this planet will be uninhabitable. This is because the root node in both decision trees is based on planet surface tempature. All 2700 planets with surface tempature greater than around ~326  Kelvin in the first tree, and ~318 Kelvin in the second were predicted to be uninhabiable. Potentially habitable planets are rare, so I was unable to find any that have been discovered since the creation of my data set.

## Impact
There are a few impacts that could result from this data. The main positive impact, is that the data could be used to predict which planets are likely habitable. When new planets are discovered, the habitability of newly discovered planets can be predicted. If planets  have incorrect habitability estimations, a few negative effects may arise. First, resources dedicated to space exploration may be sent to planets that turn out to be uninhabitable. Second, highly habitable planets could be ignored if they do not fit our current knowledge of habitability. We only have one planet we can truly base our habitability measurements off of, Earth. Furthermore, we only have species from our planet to base our understanding of life on. There may exist conditions or factors that support life that we currently do not understand yet.
