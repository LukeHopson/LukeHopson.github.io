## Introduction to the Data
I found a data set of 900,000 hands of Blackjack. The data set has colums like: cards1-5, win/loss, player sum (first two cards), dealer sum, etc. With this data, I would like to make a classification model that can predict a win/loss based on a player and dealer starting hand.
