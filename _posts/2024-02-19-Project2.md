## Introduction to the Data
I found a data set that consists of roughly 4,000 planets outside of our Solar System. The data set has 112 columns which cover statistcs for both a planet and its nearest star. Some of these include: gravity, distance from star, temperature, star type and wether or not the planet is within the habitible zone. Most importantly, there is a column making an estimate on the habitability of the planet. With this data set, I would like to make a classification model to predict the habitability of any given exoplanet.
