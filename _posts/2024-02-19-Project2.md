## Introduction to the Data
I found a data set that consists of roughly 4,000 planets outside of our Solar System. The dataset has 118 columns which cover statistics for both a planet and its nearest star. Some of these include but are not limited to: gravity, distance from star, temperature, star mass, planet type and tidal lock. Most importantly, there is a column making an estimate on the habitability of the planet. With this dataset, I would like to make a classification model to predict the habitability of any given exoplanet. I originally found the data on Kaggle, but found an updated version of the dataset from the orignal source.
## Pre-processing
Overall, this data set was fairly clean. Out of 118 columns, there were a few that were completly null, which I removed. Other than this, I removed a few uncessary columns that consisted of planet, constellation and star names. 

Next, I removed all columns that had 'MIN' and 'MAX' in them. This is because there were a few columns relating to a the potential error in NASA's math caculations. For example, the column P_MASS_ERROR_MAX (max error for the estimated planet mass). These will have no effect on planet habitability. Interestingly, before these had been pruned, my models incorrectly decided that these as columns had high relation to habitability. 

Next, I used dummies to set columns with the type 'object' to boolean values. 

Lastly, set x to be habitability, y to every other column, then split the data into training and testing sets. I chose a split of 80% training to 20% testing. 
## Data Visualization
I modeled the data with a decision tree where the x variable is habitability and y is all the other columns. NOTE: After this point is heavily WIP. Some variables that have no effect are used such as max error for planet size, I need to go back and prune these from my data set, and try again.

Orange is uninhabitable, purple is highly likely to be habitable, green is possibly habitable.

The accuracy score of .99654 is very good
