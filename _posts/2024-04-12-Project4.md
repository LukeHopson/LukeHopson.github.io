## Introduction
## What is Clustering?
## The Data
The data set I am using contains the measurements of around 200 wheat seeds. The factors included are:
1. area
2. perimeter
3. compactness
4. length of kernel
5. width of kernel
6. asymmetry coefficient
7. length of kernel groove

## Pre-Processing
In pre-processing, the first thing I did was check for null data. 

![null](assets/seednulls.png)

This data set is very clean, as there are no null values in the entire set. After this, I standardized the data
## Modeling
# K-Means Clustering
![k](assets/k.png)

Calculate the optimal value of K. Based on the graph it appears to be 3.

# Agglomerative
WIP


## Analysis
Next, I added shapes to represent the wheat seed type.  

![null](assets/seednulls.png)

From this chart, we can see that not all seeds of the same type belong to the same clusters.
