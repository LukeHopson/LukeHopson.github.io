## Introduction
In the United States, wheat is the third most planted crop, making it incredibly important for both food avalibility, as well as economic prospects in agricultural regions. There are a large variety of different wheat types, each of these with seeds that have different attributes. With this project, I aim to cluster the wheat seeds.
## What is Clustering?
Clustering is a unsupervised machine learning method. Two types of clustering are K-Means and Agglomerative. In this project, I will be using K-means.
#### K-Means:
The K-means clustering algorithm works by clustering a dataset into a set number of clusters, denoted by 'K'. Intial cluster centers are assigned at random, and each point is assigned to the nearest cluster center. After this, the mean value of each cluster center is calcualted. These become the location of new cluster centers, and the process of assigning each point to a cluster is repeated. This process continues until there are no longer changes in the location of new clusters. 
#### Agglomerative:
With the agglomerative clustering method, each data point starts out as its own cluster. These are then merged with the closest cluster until only one cluster is left. By producing a chart called a dendogram, we can then select the ideal number of clusters. 
## The Data
The data set I am using contains the measurements of 210 wheat seeds. There are 3 different kinds of wheat included (Kama, Rosa and Canadian), each with 70 samples. The factors included in this dataset are:
1. area
2. perimeter
3. compactness
4. length of kernel
5. width of kernel
6. asymmetry coefficient
7. length of kernel groove

## Data Understanding

Looking at the lenths and widths of the seeds, there appears to be a positive correlation. Larger seeds tend to larger both length and width-wise.

After plotting the kernel area by seed type, we can a trend. There is overlap between the seed types, but seed type 3 generally tends to be the smallest, 2 the largest and 1 is in between those.

Next, I created a correlation matrix to see which features were related to each other. In the matrix, the closer a value is to 1 or negative 1, the stronger the correlation. Here we can see quite a few strong correlations. For example, area and perimeter (.99), then width of kernel and area (.97). 


## Pre-Processing
In pre-processing, the first thing I did was check for null data. 

![null](assets/seednulls.png)

This data set is very clean, as there are no null values in the entire set. After this, I standardized the data. The data set had a target variable with the seed type, I made sure to remove this column before beginning my modeling.
## Modeling
For my modeling, I chose to use the K-means clustering method. I chose this method because it is both simple for me to implement, and easy for readers to understand. K-means also has the benefit of efficient with large datasets, but that will not matter here, as my data set is relatively small.

I used the elbow method to calculate the optimal value of K. Based on the graph it appears to be at 3 clusters.

## Storytelling
With the modeling done, I added shapes to represent the seed type, to see if the clusters were consistent with the variety of seed.

From this chart, we can see that while not every seed of the same type belongs to the same clusters, the groups are highly correlated with the type.

## Impact
There are a few potental impacts of information like this. On the positive side, if we had a mixed collection of wheat seeds, it may be possible to sort them into groups that broadly correlate with the seed type with using a clustering algorithm. It is common for farmers to plant a single field with multiple varieties of wheat, in order to improve the crop survival rate against disease and pests. Due to this, there could also be a few negative consequences. Farmers could decide to use one seed type, which may increase the risk of crop failure.
