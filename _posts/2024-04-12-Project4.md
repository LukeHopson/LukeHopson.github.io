## Introduction
## What is Clustering?
## The Data
The data set I am using contains the measurements of around 200 wheat seeds. The factors included are:
1. area
2. perimeter
3. compactness
4. length of kernel
5. width of kernel
6. asymmetry coefficient
7. length of kernel groove

## Pre-Processing
In pre-processing, the first thing I did was check for null data. This data set is very clean, as there are no null values in the entire set.
