## Introduction
In the United States, wheat is the third most planted crop, making it incredibly important for both food avalibility and economic prospects in agricultural regions. There are a large variety of different wheat types, each of these with seeds that have different attributes. With this project, I aim to cluster the wheat seeds.
## What is Clustering?
Clustering is a unsupervised machine learning method. Two types of clustering are K-Means and Agglomerative. In this project, I will be using K-means.
#### K-Means:
#### Agglomerative:
## The Data
The data set I am using contains the measurements of 210 wheat seeds. There are 3 different kinds of wheat included (Kama, Rosa and Canadian), each with 70 samples. The factors included in this dataset are:
1. area
2. perimeter
3. compactness
4. length of kernel
5. width of kernel
6. asymmetry coefficient
7. length of kernel groove

## Pre-Processing
In pre-processing, the first thing I did was check for null data.

This data set is very clean, as there are no null values in the entire set. After this, I standardized the data. The data set had a target variable with the seed type, I made sure to remove this column before beginning my modeling.
## Modeling
### K-Means Clustering
![k](assets/k.png)

I used the elbow method to calculate the optimal value of K. Based on the graph it appears to be at 3 clusters.

## Analysis
Next, I added shapes to represent the wheat seed type.

From this chart, we can see that not all seeds of the same type belong to the same clusters.
